# VIBO/INTEGRADO Extension

## Background
My mother is a teacher at VIBO Sint-Barbara, where educators use a software platform called Integrado to manage student information, schedules, and other administrative tasks. Among the tools available, some teachers use the 'Opdrachtenkaart'â€”a card that contains specific goals for each student that they have to achieve. This card is manually created using Word and needs to be filled out individually for every student.

## Problem
The process of creating these 'Opdrachtenkaart' cards is time-consuming and repetitive. Teachers always need to manually input data into Word documents for each student, which is takes a lot of time.

## Solution
To solve this problem, I developed a Chrome extension that automates the creation of these cards. With the extension installed, relevant student data is automatically pulled from Integrado and inserted into a pre-designed PDF. This results in a significant time savings, as teachers no longer need to manually generate these cards.
